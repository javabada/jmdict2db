# JMdict to database converter

A project where I aim to convert the JMdict dictionary file from its glorious
XML format into a database, and hopefully learn a thing or two about Go and
databases in the process.

JMdict is a Japanese/English dictionary project begun by Jim Breen in 1991.
More information and the dictionary file can be found
[here](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project).
